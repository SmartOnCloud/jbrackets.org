 * This class defines constants and convenience methods for the handling of modifiers as defined by the JVM.
 * <p>
 * Notice: This class should be named <code>IClass.IModifier</code>, but changing the name would break existing client
 * code. Thus it won't be renamed until there's a really good reason to do it (maybe with a major design change).
